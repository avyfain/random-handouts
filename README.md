# The Random Handout Problem - A Simulation

A quick simulation inspired by a thought experiment from [Uri Wilensky](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/Uri.shtml), who studies agent based modeling at Northwestern University.

The question he poses is counterintuitive:

> Imagine a room full of 100 people with 100 dollars each. With every tick of the clock, every person with money gives a dollar to one randomly chosen other person. After some time progresses, how will the money be distributed?

Take a look at the [notebook](random_handout_problem.ipynb) for a full explanation.
